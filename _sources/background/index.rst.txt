Adding capabilities for passive scalar/ sediment modeling to the tidal_flow_calculator, in two fashions.
1) lagrangian transport of passive scalars

This is based on Jay Hariharan's work on scalar transport.  The 'passive particles' notebook demonstrates transport through vegetation patches.

2) sediment erosion and transport

This is based on Mariotti and Murshid (2018), implementing the erosion and sediment transport components of the matlab model in the existing landlab tidal flow version.

The examples show Jupyter Notebooks for implementing these new model vesrions.
