The CoastalTeam worked with the tidal flow calculator (available `here <https://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/gt/tidal-flow-component>`_ as of 8/19/2020).

The tidal flow calculator is based on the work of Mariotti and Murshid (2018) [1]_ and has been partially integrated into `Landlab <http://landlab.github.io/>`_. In this project, our group had the following 2 objects:

1. Add sediment erosion capabilities to the `Landlab <http://landlab.github.io/>`_ tidal flow calculator.


2. Couple with a lagrangian particle router (`dorado <https://passah2o.github.io/dorado/>`_).


To help make the work we have done more accessible, we have organized our workflows into jupyter notebooks. These notebooks can be viewed as rendered HTMLs in our documentation (:ref:`examples`), or they can be downloaded from our `repository <https://github.com/espin-2020/CoastalTeam>`_.
